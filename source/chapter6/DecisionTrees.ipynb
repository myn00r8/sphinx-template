The way the classification works is based on the petal length, if the petal length is smaller or greater than 2.45 cm it will take specific steps to classify that petal lenght to specific type of flower. So, first it will ask if the petal lenght is less than 2.45cm if it is, it will automatically move down to the left child node and because this is the only child node it will not ask any other question, ending the decision tree predicting that the flower is an iris setosa. But if the petal lenght is greater than 2.45cm it will move down to the right child node and because there is another chid node it will ask if the petal width is smaller than 1.74cm if it is, it will assume that the flower is an iri versicolor and if not it will assume that it is an iris virginica.\n",
